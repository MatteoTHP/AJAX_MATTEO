DEPRECATION WARNING: [Devise] `DeviseHelper#devise_error_messages!` is deprecated and will be
removed in the next major version.

Devise now uses a partial under "devise/shared/error_messages" to display
error messages by default, and make them easier to customize. Update your
views changing calls from:

    <%= devise_error_messages! %>

to:

    <%= render "devise/shared/error_messages", resource: resource %>

To start customizing how errors are displayed, you can copy the partial
from devise to your `app/views` folder. Alternatively, you can run
`rails g devise:views` which will copy all of them again to your app.

Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
